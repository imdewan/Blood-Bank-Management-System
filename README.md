<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project




This is my first project in python.
It uses Tkinter module for front-end and MySQL-connector for back-end development.

Also uses json to store database login details and os for validating if file exists.

This will automatically create the database and tables | Just run the script
If you want to connect to other SQL server then delete the 'config_db.json' file.

More changes will be made later.
